# employees-analysis-using-sql
It is a in-depth employees analysis using SQL. I have used PostsgreSQL as RDBMS.
The dataset used has around 3-4 Lakh rows and there are multiple datasets divided according to the purpose they serve such as 

1) "employees" dataset has employees names, employee no, birth date, hiring date
2) "dept_emp" has employee no and there respective dept_no(department no)
3) "departments" has dept_no and dept_name(department name)
4) "dept_manager" has details of employees that are manager
5) "salaries" table has salaries etc of employees
6) "titles" has tites and more details of employees

**Note :-** Check datasets to check for exact details of various columns.
